<p>If you are salaried employee and thinking where to invest your money to get the maximum percentage of interest, then you have landed on the right page, investing in share market is the best option.</p>

<p>Share market has two things one is trading and another one is investing. If you are looking for longer term and you want to play safe, I would suggest to go with investing, that’s what I do.</p>

<p><strong>Trading:</strong> Where you buy a share on opening of market and sell on closing of market. This is for professional people, who have full knowledge over the share market. This can be very risky for new players.</p>

<p><strong>Investing:</strong> Where you buys one share and keep it, till whenever you want. You must be thinking ,‘how do I get money out of it’ :P.</p>

<p>Let’s say, we want to buy one share of Bharti Airtel which is costing Rs 326/- acc. to today’s market.</p>

<p><em>P.S. Before buying any shares first look into their previous graphs and future prediction, it’s for your satisfaction, just for assuring yourself that you are not throwing arrow in dark</em>.</p>

<p>There is something called dividend, when any company makes profit after cutting out all their expenses and still hold money and want to give some
profit to their shareholders, they give that money to all of their shareholders based on their shares.</p>

<p>If I put it in more technical terms <em>“A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company’s earnings, decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders. Dividends can be issued as cash payments, as shares of stock, or other property.” - Investopedia</em></p>

<p>So, dividend is one source of profit, and another one is your investment getting its valued high, as company grows, share market will also get high.</p>

<p>But as we all know nothing comes so easy :P</p>

<p>Only thing you need to do is keeping a closer look on everyday’s market value of that company. Sometimes you can get even 100% rate of interest. :)</p>

<h4 id="now-its-time-to-get-our-hands-dirty-for-real-d">Now its time to get our hands dirty for real :D</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get your PAN Card ready.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bank A/C ( It’s always good to have a privatised bank account for share market purpose.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open NSDL demat account <em>OR</em> open a demat account in  your respective bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a broker near your area, or there are some banks which provides facility within their bank itself like ICICI Direct. In ICICI direct you don’t need any broker you can invest on your own. You need to have one among these two, to sell or purchase the shares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hurray! you are good to go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a check in the name of your broker and tell him what share, how many and on what price you want to buy <em>OR</em> If you have ICICI direct kind of account, you can purchase or sell the shares on your own with just one click.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any doubt about, what share to buy you can always subscribe to CNBC Channel and their daily newspapers.</p>

<p>Before starting in real, if you like to have some demo kind of thing where you can first try, there are some applications which does that. One of them is moneycontrol which I use personally. Moneycontrol mobile application is really good you can even whish list your company, and you will keep getting notifications about everydays growth.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading :)</p>
