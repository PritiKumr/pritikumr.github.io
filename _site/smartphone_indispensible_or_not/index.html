<p>Smart phones like any other technology aid to the comfort of human beings.
As the name suggests, they are ‘smart ‘ , in the sense they have their own intelligence which allow user’s wit to take  back seat in dealing with day- today chores.
Adding to the comfort, they have made things go ‘instant’ too.
This has been made possible through the development of various applications popularly known as ‘apps’.
There are multiple apps available for a specific purpose, be it messaging or a cab service. I shall not get into this because we are well aware of them.
In short, they have brought comfort on our finger tips. And not just the comfort, it has uplifted our society in every aspects.</p>

<p>And this trend will go on. It is growing at a pace we are not even able to realize .But we have to pause our tech driven life game and contemplate. Have these devices occupied an irreplaceable corner of our existence or is it just enslavement? In other words, can we really not survive without them or is it just a habit or say a comfort zone we have created for ourselves?</p>
