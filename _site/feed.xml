 		there all works and efforts come to naught.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so many years of &lt;em&gt;Equality Talks&lt;/em&gt;,you think women are respected? Do we actually respect women?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, No pressure. Try answering me for this one. Do women really have equal rights? Haan? Now this one, do we atleast know what are some problems faced by any woman?.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first when a girl baby is born, most Indians behave as if its a disgrace as dowry has to be given when she gets married. Dowry makes the difference. A man sells himself for the dowry and also takes away the girl and her dreams with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atleat before marriage, was she actually allowed to follow her dreams?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No! Not in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gandhi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Not every women&#39;s dream is to be married.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the first one to suppress a women is another women. When she wants to explore things,they are restricted saying that it is not meant for girls and when she fights her way out of it follows the bigger miseries. The problem starts with stalkers. Every month,there is atleast one news that somewhere a tech girl has been raped or murdered or both. The aftereffect of this, some parents who left their daughter to follow their dreams also start to restrict them. Why? Just why? You don’t know how much we fought for a chance to pursue our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the buzz word &lt;em&gt;marriage&lt;/em&gt;. Most women choose to stay with their husband despite the assaults they go through. Now why is that? Only because they are afraid of the society and feel this is what was meant for them and is something that cannot be changed. Since her childhood the restrictions and “behave-like-a-girl” has been following her. Parents restricted her from following her dreams, she now has no idea of how to be independent and when she thinks of going back to her parents place also she would be treated as its a big disgrace for their family. So forgetting about her dreams and adjusting to the brutalities ,she starts to live for her husband. Atleast by then is she happy? Naah! There are so many unsaid murders because of dowries, impotence. Since she is not well educated,the cycle repeats.She would now restrict her daughter from following her dreams and the cycle repeats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, Education and Awareness plays the major role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you educate a woman, you educate a family, if you educate a girl, you educate the future.&lt;/strong&gt; - Queen Rania of Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t blame on the whole society. There are people who support a woman’s growth but still the cruelities continues to happen. We have identified the problem and also the solution.The problem is inequality and the solution is education. Implementation is in our hands,the future generation!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>priya_dharsini</name></author><category term="women" /><category term="empowerment" /><category term="quality" /><summary>Where women are respected, there the gods delight; and where they are not, there all works and efforts come to naught.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://rowthiram.com{&quot;feature&quot;=&gt;&quot;so-simple-sample-image-2.jpg&quot;}" /></entry><entry><title>5 Business rules on your fingertips.</title><link href="http://rowthiram.com/blog/five-rules-you-should-know-before-starting-your-business/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5 Business rules on your fingertips." /><published>2016-07-30T13:59:24+05:30</published><updated>2016-07-30T13:59:24+05:30</updated><id>http://rowthiram.com/blog/five-rules-you-should-know-before-starting-your-business</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://rowthiram.com/blog/five-rules-you-should-know-before-starting-your-business/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;key-points-of-a-business&quot;&gt;KEY POINTS OF A BUSINESS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business is a word which is used as a fashion trend these days and even sometimes referred with a  different name “startup”. People who have money or have a different idea start converting that idea into a product that could be sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey people, you missed a very important point there,  business is not just an idea, it’s a long term process, it’s not just a cycle of 1 or 2 years, but it’s a cycle of your whole life and it should continue even after your death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some points which I am going to share today with everyone, which need to be considered before starting any business. It doesn’t matter what type of business it is, either it’s a small turnover business or a big turnover, these points are common for all type of industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lets-see-the-points-now--&quot;&gt;Let’s see the points now :-&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should have the courage to handle risks:&lt;/strong&gt;  Many times big opportunities will knock your door but it won’t come alone, it will come with lots of risk involved. But If you want to grow your business, you should have the courage to handle them to take those opportunities to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should be money minded:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not about being cheap or greedy  but it’s about being a business person, even if your business has turnover of 1 Crore you can’t afford to loose even 1 rupee. There are many businesses which has just one rupee margin over one piece of product. So imagine if you sell 1 crore such product, one day how much will you earn. So, always remember every single penny counts just as every drop matters in making an ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should always be ready to learn everything:&lt;/strong&gt; In initial stage of your business, you might not be aware of different tasks involved or how much human labour will be needed to complete them. Everyone whoever works for you , they all are employees they won’t take your business as seriously as you do. So you have to be prepared for all ups and downs and you have to be ready to do whatever it takes to take your business forward. An event from my life, my dad owns a business which requires many labourers to load and unload  the truck. Once a labour got sick, who had to unload goods from a truck. My dad couldn’t say to those people to go back home as it would have taken more time to call other labourers and we had to release the truck immediately. But you cannot ask a sick labourer to work, that’s against business ethics. So, finally my dad himself worked as a labourer and helped other labourers in unloading the truck. So, you have to take the responsibility of everything whenever it is needed when you own a business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to understand it’s a 24*7 work:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything has definite time no doubt, but remember that there are things which can require your attention anytime and  sometimes it can be your business also. Now, if you own a Datacenter and in the middle of the night you experience some unintended failures, then you can’t be just sleeping you have to wake up in the middle of night and get it fixed. That’s how it works “ with great power comes greater responsibility”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your business should never go to the revenue of zero:&lt;/strong&gt; Last but not the least, the most important point, once your business start making revenues, remember whatever it takes just make sure revenue should never go to zero. If it does, it means it’s a signal that market has stopped showing interest in your business, that’s the point when you need to rework on your business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the closing lines I will just give one  advice, whatever you do,  it should solve problem of atleast one person . So before starting with anything always do a good market research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep making money ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shilpi_agrawal</name></author><category term="business" /><category term="ideas" /><summary>Business is a long term process, it’s not just a cycle of 1 or 2 years, but it’s a cycle of your whole life and it should continue even after your death.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://rowthiram.com{&quot;feature&quot;=&gt;&quot;business.jpg&quot;}" /></entry><entry><title>Start investing in just 5 minutes.</title><link href="http://rowthiram.com/blog/start-investing-in-stock-market-in-just-5-minutes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Start investing in just 5 minutes." /><published>2016-07-25T13:59:24+05:30</published><updated>2016-07-25T13:59:24+05:30</updated><id>http://rowthiram.com/blog/start-investing-in-stock-market-in-just-5-minutes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://rowthiram.com/blog/start-investing-in-stock-market-in-just-5-minutes/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;stock-market-investment&quot;&gt;STOCK MARKET INVESTMENT&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are salaried employee and thinking where to invest your money to get the maximum percentage of interest, then you have landed on the right page, investing in share market is the best option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share market has two things one is trading and another one is investing. If you are looking for longer term and you want to play safe, I would suggest to go with investing, that’s what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; Where you buy a share on opening of market and sell on closing of market. This is for professional people, who have full knowledge over the share market. This can be very risky for new players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing:&lt;/strong&gt; Where you buys one share and keep it, till whenever you want. You must be thinking ,‘how do I get money out of it’ :P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, we want to buy one share of Bharti Airtel which is costing Rs 326/- acc. to today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. Before buying any shares first look into their previous graphs and future prediction, it’s for your satisfaction, just for assuring yourself that you are not throwing arrow in dark&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something called dividend, when any company makes profit after cutting out all their expenses and still hold money and want to give some
profit to their shareholders, they give that money to all of their shareholders based on their shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I put it in more technical terms &lt;em&gt;“A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company’s earnings, decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders. Dividends can be issued as cash payments, as shares of stock, or other property.” - Investopedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, dividend is one source of profit, and another one is your investment getting its valued high, as company grows, share market will also get high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we all know nothing comes so easy :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only thing you need to do is keeping a closer look on everyday’s market value of that company. Sometimes you can get even 100% rate of interest. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;now-its-time-to-get-our-hands-dirty-for-real-d&quot;&gt;Now its time to get our hands dirty for real :D&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get your PAN Card ready.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bank A/C ( It’s always good to have a privatised bank account for share market purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open NSDL demat account &lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt; open a demat account in  your respective bank.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find a broker near your area, or there are some banks which provides facility within their bank itself like ICICI Direct. In ICICI direct you don’t need any broker you can invest on your own. You need to have one among these two, to sell or purchase the shares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hurray! you are good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write a check in the name of your broker and tell him what share, how many and on what price you want to buy &lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt; If you have ICICI direct kind of account, you can purchase or sell the shares on your own with just one click.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any doubt about, what share to buy you can always subscribe to CNBC Channel and their daily newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting in real, if you like to have some demo kind of thing where you can first try, there are some applications which does that. One of them is moneycontrol which I use personally. Moneycontrol mobile application is really good you can even whish list your company, and you will keep getting notifications about everydays growth.&lt;/p&gt;

Although there are huge deals in amazon, there is no filter for us to sort the products we like based on the discount available for the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make use of a simple search element to get products with discounted price. It works on both Amazon.com and Amazon India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample screenshot of the search that was performed in Clothing category to get deals with 80-90% discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/amazon_hack_1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I get deals that have 80-90% discount? Yayy! Simple shopping hacks. A very simple search string was used to find the discounted items in the selected category in Amazon site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to the amazing part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  www.amazon.com/gp/search/?node=nodenumber&amp;amp;pct-off=x-y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon India&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  www.amazon.in/gp/search/?node=nodenumber&amp;amp;pct-off=x-y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the main URL that is used search through our selected category for the best discounted products. The URL isn’t ready to use, you need to make slight modifications to the URL as per your requirements. The ‘x’ and ‘y’ at the end of the URL are the parameters that define your discount range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;www.amazon.in/gp/search/?node=nodenumber&amp;amp;pct-off=80-90
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This URL when complete will fetch you all the products with discounts inbetween 80 to 90 percent. We still have to make a slight tweak to the URL to get the result that we wanted, we need to set the category for which we want to apply the discounted search string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has a unique node number for each category, which you can find from Amazon URL. A URL that contains nodenumber belonging to Books,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=nav_shopall_bo?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=283155
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon India&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  http://www.amazon.in/Books/b/ref=sd_allcat_books_all?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=976389031
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt; parameter in the above URL is the value we need to complete our Amazon shopping hack. Here is a screenshot that gives us the URL with the node number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/amazon_hack_3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the category you want to purchase from the Amazon site and get a hold of the nodenumber belonging to the category from the URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the node number in the URL that we have, so our final URL looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;www.amazon.in/gp/search/?node=976389031&amp;amp;pct-off=80-90
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of the discounted result for above URL,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/amazon_hack_2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​
Good luck with finding great deals on Amazon, if you do not have any available offers for the search just use different discount values to get more result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic command line control will be a really good start for this tutorial. We’re gonna build a site and launch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re gonna make use of Jekyll for easily building our static site and Github Pages for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GitHub Pages is designed to host your personal, organization,
 or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what’s jekyll?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a static site generator. In simple, it gives us a ready to use static website without the actual need for a database to store our contents,makes it extremely fast. Make slight tweaks and integrate any free themes and you are all set. You think a walk through would be much better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jekyll documentation is a big help, although very confusing for someone with no technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prerequisites to run jekyll:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You will need to install Ruby on your machine, because jekyll is powered by Ruby. Installing Ruby is really simple, follow this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; if your not sure how to start.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Also you need a package management framework for ruby to help you install the essential software packages. Follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/pages/download/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to download.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you follow these steps, moving around with Jekyll is pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will install jekyll software package to your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To verify if you have properly installed Jekyll on your machine, use the below command. Make sure the command returns something similar to ‘jekyll 3.1.6’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as your static site generation is concerned, it is all set. Now, for web developers out there - you have two options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design your blog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download and use any free themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if your really new to this, it’s the latter that you got to go with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has got a huge supported themes, choose your favorite and download them. Here is a quick &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; for fellow lazy minds. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the common directory structure of Jekyll,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├── _config.yml
├── _drafts
|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.textile
|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.markdown
├── _includes
|   ├── footer.html
|   └── header.html
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.textile
|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.textile
├── _data
|   └── members.yml
├── _site
├── .jekyll-metadata
└── index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any themes you download would contain similar directory pattern. This is the skeleton pattern, if you have a good understanding of jekyll you can customise the structure leaving the skeleton structure undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generating-your-site&quot;&gt;Generating your site.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are just 3 commands away from creating your new site,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ jekyll new NewSite
New jekyll site installed in /home/preethi/NewSite.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site generates the scaffold needed for you, in simpler terms it creates the directory skeleton structure. Use the ‘cd’ command to move into NewSite directory and execute the following,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ jekyll build
Configuration file: /home/preethi/NewSite/_config.yml
        Source: /home/preethi/NewSite
   Destination: /home/preethi/NewSite/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating... 
                    done in 1.361 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘jekyll build’ is the most important command that builds the destination site, the site that you’ve been trying to build now. Finally, fire up the server with the ‘jekyll serve’ command. You can find your site under the ‘_site’ folder in the jekyll skeleton directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ jekyll serve
Configuration file: /home/preethi/NewSite/_config.yml
        Source: /home/preethi/NewSite
   Destination: /home/preethi/NewSite/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating... 
                    done in 1.352 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for &#39;/home/preethi/NewSite&#39;
Configuration file: /home/preethi/NewSite/_config.yml
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Your server is running at port 4000. Your site is up. Add the styling that you want or use free themes. Change all site configurations in the ‘_config.yml’ file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do next is add your posts in the ‘_post’ directory. Use ‘jekyll build’ command after every update to the site, to regenerate the destination site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Push it to your github repository, create an orphan branch ‘gh-pages’ and push all settings to it. For more information on Github Pages hosting, refer to this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages

# Creates our branch, without any parents (it&#39;s an orphan!)
Switched to a new branch &#39;gh-pages&#39;

$ git commit -a -m &quot;First pages commit&quot;
$ git push origin gh-pages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After your push to the gh-pages branch, your Project Pages site will be available at &lt;em&gt;http(s)://GithubUsername.github.io/ProjectName&lt;/em&gt; . Note that Pages are always publicly accessible when published, even if their repository is private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ubuntu is one of the widely used Linux distros, getting your hands on it is a must-know thing for most people entering the software field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different ways of installing Ubuntu. In this guide I’m gonna walk you through one such way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu can be installed in various scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may install Ubuntu on a computer with no operating system at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may install Ubuntu with some other operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also installing Ubuntu with other operating system,(also termed dual-booting) there are various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install Ubuntu from USB Stick.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install it using Virtual Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install it using wubi installer i.e. especially designed for Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we will see how to install dual boot Ubuntu alongside another operating system, in our case it’s Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin. :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;download-and-get-ready&quot;&gt;Download and Get Ready:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download Ubuntu:&lt;/strong&gt; Download your preferred version of Ubuntu such as Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10, 16.04 and there’s a lot more versions, latest being 16.04. You can easily get any of its versions just by clicking here. Download time of this huge file of more than 1GB totally depends on your bandwidth speed. If your on BSNL, we’re on the same boat. :P&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burn your CD or create a boot able USB stick:&lt;/strong&gt; For this step you need software which is designed especially for Ubuntu i.e. .Universal USB Installer. There are a lot more installers to solve this purpose, this is more promising.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure your BIOS&lt;/strong&gt;. Enter your systems boot settings(BIOS) and set boot order option. Entering Boot settings various between various models, so google to find the key to enter the Boot settings.So, whenever your computer starts, press the BIOS key. My case it was - F2 Key.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plug in your USB stick/Live CD and restart the machine. After entering to the setup, select the device you want to boot: - live CD or USB stick. The installer will automatically take you to this screen.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
     &lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 15%;&quot; src=&quot;/images/ubuntu_install_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Whether you want to install it or try it, you will have to follow the same procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After booting from your live CD or USB, you will get to the Try or Install window. Before you start the installation, make sure your computer is connected to the Internet. If your network connection is not working, Click Try Ubuntu and let it load. Then go to the top right&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; ** Click on the gear icon -&amp;gt; select System settings -&amp;gt; Additional Drivers -&amp;gt; it will search for the drivers for the network adapter -&amp;gt; click on the drivers to install -&amp;gt; then from the Desktop select Install Ubuntu. **
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before beginning the installation, system will need three necessary things.
     1. Connection to the power source.
     2. Connection to the network.
     3. At least 4.8 GB free in your hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
     &lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 15%;&quot; src=&quot;/images/ubuntu_install_2.1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can proceed when you have all these set up, although the first two are not absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For installation you will have three options in dialog box, select third option. i.e. Something else. Select it and click Install Now. We’re almost Done, but coming next is the tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
     &lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 15%;&quot; src=&quot;/images/ubuntu_install_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While installation is going on you’ll get the information about your unallocated space and allocated space. Select one of the unallocated space in which you want to install Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
     &lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 15%;&quot; src=&quot;/images/ubuntu_install_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, this is where you are going to instruct the machine about the memory settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to create three partitions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select the unallocated space or drive, click on (+) , a new dialog box will appear. In the drop down menu select swap area and the size will depend on your RAM size. i.e 1GB of Swap would be perfect for a system with 4GB RAM. Now, do the Math. :P&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get back to the same dialog box, press Add. In the drop down menu of the new dialog box, select mount point as /boot and size will be 512 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again return back to the same dialog box, click Add. In the drop down menu of the new dialog box select mount point as / and size will be rest of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally click on Install, and Ubuntu will start installing on your system. The progress will be shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proceed to configue Time and Network settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes! We installed Ubuntu. Now start playing with it. Have Fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shilpi_agrawal</name></author><category term="dual-boot" /><category term="ubuntu" /><category term="os" /><summary>Ubuntu is Linux based open source operating system which is basically designed for programming addicts.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://rowthiram.com{&quot;feature&quot;=&gt;&quot;ubuntu.jpg&quot;}" /></entry><entry><title>My First Job Experience</title><link href="http://rowthiram.com/articles/my-first-job-experience/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My First Job Experience" /><published>2016-07-18T13:55:35+05:30</published><updated>2016-07-18T13:55:35+05:30</updated><id>http://rowthiram.com/articles/my-first-job-experience</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://rowthiram.com/articles/my-first-job-experience/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just another regular 2016 passout with much hopes in life, I found a new side of myself in this journey of 2 months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fresher,I joined an IT company as a software trainee.Since I am from EEE department,I was little nervous thinking whether I could survive in the company.Unlike other IT companies,Here for few weeks they thought us how to analyse a problem.After we came to an understanding of how to analyse a problem,the next phase of training started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-phase&quot;&gt;FIRST PHASE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project requirement was kept in front of us.It was to create a web application for recruiting process.It consisted of  four modules such as generic module,HR module,Jobseeker module and Employee module.It was then split among 10 of us and we started to work on it.
At first I didn’t feel any difficulty as the first step was to analyse the requirement,prepare BRD,FSD,wireframes and get approval from the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-phase&quot;&gt;SECOND PHASE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phase was UI design training.The trainer taught us in such a way that the training was so interesting and it kept us committed.HTML and CSS was new to me.I started to learn every day and started to try it practically.I was keep on experimenting unti I came to an understanding.By then ,we 10 of us were clear about basics of HTML and CSS.We started to design our pages as per our wireframes using bootstrap.First we were trained with plain html and then we were taught about bootstrap such that we felt easy and was very clear  about the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;margin-left:20%;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/priya_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Yes! I made it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-phase&quot;&gt;THIRD PHASE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third phase was validation before the datas hit the database.They taught us javascript and Jquery.I found it  very interesting because with Jquery we can do wonders without making the page reload.Ajax concept was so cool such that we can call upon a function using url without reloading
the page.Jquery effects,traversing functions and much more functions.It was very interesting such that we tried making tabs,accordion on our own.Untill then everything went cool and I enjoyed learning these and also felt easy implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fourth-phase&quot;&gt;FOURTH PHASE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we completing validations.We were into the php training.Our pages were put into mvc architecture(Model View Controller).We created tables in mysql as defined in FSD and then started work on functionalities.The trainer taught us how to make a login page,some of the php functions,session and cookies.We had test on every Monday for four weeks.First three weeks it was theoritical and it consisted of logical questions.Some how we cleared our tests.I learnt how to use html inside php code and vice versa.PHP is like an ocean when we start exploring it,we start to realise how interesting the langauge is.All we have to do is get involved with it,start exploring it.When I first joined this company,I didn’t even know to define a class,method and declare a variable also.Now i have confidence,that i can create a web application on my own.Debugging an error in php is also an interesting factor.We learnt to use firebug,check page source and rectify the errors.Now the fourth phase has also been completed successfully and the journey with the company continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna be sharing more of my posts until the world knows me. Stay connected.

A little later life found it’s way a few billion years later. Evolution took us for a ride bringing us to this point in time. Looking back to the early stages of human, there was some thing that was missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;what-was-it-not-sure&quot;&gt;What was it? Not Sure?&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication&lt;/em&gt;, without which life would be really boring. Now, we communicate using words but what about some million years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No alphabets. No words. Yet our ancestors managed to survive without words for communication. Isn’t that something amazing to even think about. :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how did they communicate? How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;umm-illustrations&quot;&gt;Umm, Illustrations.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors communicated with their neighbours using illustrations. What is Illustration? Now stop thinking technically. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its nothing but the action or means of illustrating something. Doesn’t stop with just that. Hmm, It also mean as expressing by as Drawings or Designs. Cool. Ain’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old sculptures, statues, art works always stand an epitome for how cool communication was earlier. The beautiful and intricate Illustrations in it shows us Illustration was the main key for communication those days. It made people understand things easily and it also helped the differently abled(deaf and dumb) to not really think themselves any lesser people. But, as days and years passed with technological advancements people started to forget the beauty in communication using Illustrations. I see people using more of words to communicate and not the illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so bad to see the world putting an end to a beautiful art of communication. If Illustration was the key for communication in 2016 and not words , there is absolutely no need for any languages or translators to communicate. It would have made world more united and simple to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words are just too complicated. Are they not? By the way, too ambuiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, Ha ha ! I use more of words but I always wanted illustrations to be my primary source of communication. It gives me more knowledge and deepens my ability to understand things with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think the same way? Let me know. :D&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>venkat_subish</name></author><category term="language" /><category term="communication" /><category term="words" /><category term="interaction" /><summary>Illustrations or Words,making communication simple and beautiful?

Employee Referral is a simple internal recruitment method to interview and hire more employees through the referrals provided by their existing employees. Even though there are many ways for recruiting employee, 40% of companies opt for referral recruiting and you know why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the top 6 reasons why companies recruit people by reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;save-time&quot;&gt;SAVE TIME!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timing is everything. The recruitment process is small and easy than compared with other methods of recruiting and also people hired by reference start their new position sooner than their counterparts. Referred hires have job satisfaction and stay in the job for longer than the other recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;save-money&quot;&gt;SAVE MONEY!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referral recruitment is the cheapest way for recruiting so economically it is the best way for recruitment. The company would always go for the way which is economically best&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quality-is-important&quot;&gt;QUALITY IS IMPORTANT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the respondents feel that the referral recruiting is the best way for finding the best quality employee. With the increased demand for quality service and products, it has become important for companies to hire more skilled and productive employees. Research has shown that the employees who are hired through the various referral schemes are significantly better and more efficient than the ones hired through the other channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compatible&quot;&gt;COMPATIBLE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referred hires fit the company culture and values better because the referral already knows one of the employee and the company already. As the candidates who apply through other channels can be from any locality, or field of work, there are higher possibilities of them not being accustomed to the organization’s work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;immediate-results&quot;&gt;IMMEDIATE RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the growing unemployment and the demand for a more skilled workforce, employees are the best way of finding some quick leads and almost double the number of hires within a year. The referral bonuses are often lucrative and lead to a higher employee satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a quick and easy way of generating more and more candidates to hire within your organization, employee referral scheme is certainly the best tactic that you can opt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-is-all-that-matters&quot;&gt;TRUST IS ALL THAT MATTERS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employee knows the referral already thus the company would have full trust on the person through referral recruitment because even when the referral cheats the company or any misbehavior tends to happen still the person could be caught through the referred employee&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>priya_dharsini</name></author><category term="employee-referral" /><category term="readability" /><category term="quality" /><summary>Why employee referrals?
