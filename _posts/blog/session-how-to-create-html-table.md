I have recently learnt how to make a web application during the training I underwent as I mentioned earlier in my last article, follow this <a href="/articles/my-first-job-experience">link</a> incase you missed my previous writing. I came up with a thought that I would share with you people what I have learnt :).Just flow the steps I insist and you would be successfull as I am now.

Before beginning,

what is HTML?

*HyperText Markup Language*

HTML and CSS are used to design the front end and they are static.

Basic syntax for HTML,

1. Copy paste this in your note pad and save as test.html

```html
{% raw %}
<html>
	<head>
		<!--comment line-->
		<!--linking of css js files are done in head tag -->
		<!--whatever you write inside title tag becomes the title for your output-->
		<title> Rowthiram Sample1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	<!--Run and see for the usage of different header tags-->
	<h1> Rowthiram Header1</h1>
	<h2> Rowthiram Header2</h2>
	<h3> Rowthiram Header3</h3>
	<h4> Rowthiram Header4</h4>
	<p>
		<!--This is a paragraph tag-->
		Hi all. This is a paragraph in our Rowthiram page.
	</p>
	
	</body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
```

2. Enter your filepath on the browser and click enter

For example,
	file:///home/infiniti/Desktop/untitled.html

You would find your amazing basic HTML tags put to work.
