## That’s the thing with money, it demands to be spent :P

This article is all about middle class people like us. 

We all are running in a rat race and we knew that already.
How much ever the money we earn, it is like it’s never enough as one of the old Tamil songs signify?

>	Varavu  etana selavu pathana adhigam rendenna kadaisiyil thunthana

Some of us are really stressed about getting caught in this loop. 	But I am here to say it is completely okay.

Would you guys accept with me, if I say we learn things easily by practice than theoretical? 

I know most of them would say, Yes! How boring life would be if there is no struggle at all in our life? Feel proud of all the struggles you face in your life. In future, you would have so many stories to tell your children and make them feel inspired.

Let me share something with you people. An example to feel content with what we have! A Week earlier, we were in a hurry to go on a family trip, since it was a sudden plan, we didn’t have time to do shipping.
We ran into a road side slipper shop. There was this shopkeeper from whom I learnt we can be happy with what we have (Yes! We can create illusion that we are happy :P).
He sold slippers only for 30% profit. He sold the slippers for 100rs whereas same model slipper with same quality would have been sold for 300rs in showroom.

The customer service he provided was way far better than the people who provide in big showrooms.
As I was in a hurry, I didn’t mind about the quality. I chose one slipper and opted to pay for it.
But he (the shopkeeper) made me realise that I have chosen the good quality slipper by comparing it with another one which in turn made me happy. So I decided not to bargain with him and paid 170rs for the slipper I bought.

Finally he said “You would come back to buy another slipper, if you like the quality and the service I have provided you”

I was happy with his customer service which in turn made him happy!

At the end of the day, real happiness comes from satisfaction of the work you do.Of course Money is important for our needs but we should realise that our needs are never ending. We all care about what others would say/think of us, What if we are not getting promoted, What if we are not getting the salary we expect, What if we are not being recognized for the jobs we do.

But personally we all know our potential; we know what we are capable of. Then why to care about what others say? Continuous learning is the key. Like that of Tamil proverb.

> Kadamaiyai sei, palanai edhir parkathey

The 4 lessons to be learnt from the shopkeeper:

1. Feel contend with what you have.
2. Do the best you can.
3. Be truthful to you.
4. Be proactive.

If you follow these 4 golden lessons in your life, there are lot of chances of you getting away from the rat race and also be stress free. 

As I stated earlier, Money demands to be spent whereas as self satisfaction never fades away.
The choice is yours...
