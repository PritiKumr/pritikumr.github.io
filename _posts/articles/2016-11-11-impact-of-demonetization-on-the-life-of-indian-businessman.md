Time has come for the historical reforms of the economy of India. I feel it is a one life time boldest movements by the Government of India. This scheme is going to impact the businesses, the Aam Admi, and financial institutions – all at some level or the other.

The driving force behind this historical decision was to eradicate black money. A recent study had pegged India’s black market economy at over Rs 30 lakh crore or about 20 percent of total GDP. This is even bigger than the GDP’s of many countries.

With this move in play, black money holders are left with only option to route this money through banks, declaring it to be their income. You know the after effects, the question arises that how did they earn that income? Their files would be subjected to scrutiny and huge taxes will be applicable. Even if they show this as income in the normal course of business, they will have to pay taxes on it as per current rate.

Now let us come to our topic what effects would you find in BLG?? Following consequences/impact may happen and which can be identified:

1.    Sudden decrease in Stock: A client can justify Cash deposit by realization of closing stock. There might be a mismatch of the stock in holding.

2.    Realization of Debtors: Debtors will be realized to show cash in their account, which may imply the cash deposited is related to business activity.

3.    Sudden increase in Sales: You may see a significant exponential growth in sales prior to cut-off date. (Due to back dated billing).

4.    Unusual increase in profit margin: A client might remove miscellaneous expenses from expenses head so that it will have effect on profit margin and cash in hand.

5.    Unusual increase in other Income: To justify the cash deposited, other income might be there in the name of Income from Tution, Professional Fees, and Commission Income etc.

6.    Gift Income: Cash taken as gift from relatives only, can be easily justified to account the cash deposited.

7.    Steep increase in loan from Relatives: Cash might be deposited in relatives account and from there client can take as a loan.

8.    Sale of Jewelry: If there is jewelry in Balance Sheet, cash deposited might be justified with the sale of jewelry.

9.    Credit Summations: Credit summations in the period of October and November can be seen high as compared to other months.

10. Property Value: Property value is expected to reduce. Further, for enhancement cases, we need to be careful particularly where collateral cover is less than 100%.

11. Diversion of funds: The locker for black money are the sectors like Jewelry and real estate, now the gates are open where clients have less scope to divert their funds.
