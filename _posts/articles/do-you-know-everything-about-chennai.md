Chennai has its own standard and awesomeness. In the era of technology where Ola and Uber has taken over most mode of transport, our amazing auto richshaw drivers have started something of their own to keep things seemless.

Amidst the rude and uncouth auto rickshaw people in the city, these group of people have set a fair price ride along a receipt fo all your rides.

You better believe it.

The drivers are super polite, and they are paid salaries, which has nothing to do with the amount their meters tick off.

Please share with Chennai residents and visitors so they don't have to get ripped off by all the other uncouth disservices.  You can call this at the railway station too. The auto will wait for you.
