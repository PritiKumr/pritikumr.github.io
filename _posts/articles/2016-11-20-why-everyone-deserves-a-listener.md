In this fast growing world, there is no time for anyone to speak or share upon their feelings.

I just wanted to share a success story about a girl who always longed for a listener 

You may think what is so special about finding a listener? Or what is going to change if you have anyone to listen to you? Actually it makes a hell a lot of difference.

Let me begin this story!
A girl named is Tina (Imaginary of coourse :P). Tina is a kind of girl who thinks a lot. She observes every small thing around her and starts thinking about it. She thinks about life, movies, love, physics, stars, philosophy, programming, etc. and keeps everything inside herself because when she tries to share her thoughts with people, they either don’t have time for her or pretends as if they are hearing to what she says.

I know now you may think, what is so sad about not having a listener.

*Having a listener is like a stress buster*, it also satisfies your soul. Tina being in her young age already gone through many unfortunate happenings, (I would share about that in my next article) wanted to come out of it. Speak out to people because talking is the best therapy. Of course she had friends but they were busy with their own life and she couldn’t blame upon them either because that’s all about life.

People run behind things and forget to live their moments.

One day, she met a guy (DON’T ASK ME HOW). A new person in her life both started to share upon their interests. 

> Him: I like to speak about a lot of things ranging from physics till business, but I don’t find anyone to hear them. You know as it is nerdy-nerdy.

> Tina: I hear to people. I like doing that so that they will hear to me.
(Hahaha yeah it was like a pick up line). **

And they started to speak, speak, speak and yet have some more topics to be spoken on.
Actually, she was the one who was speaking continuously. She spoke everything what came to her mind. She has never been so comfortable with anyone to speak all her mind out.
The way he nods, the way he listens to her encouraged her to speak more.

One should be blessed to have any such listener. It makes us to feel contended.
One thing I want to say is to be available to people, listen to them. When your mom shares her daily troubles listen to her, many of us ignore that. Listen to them; listen to anyone who shares about their feelings. 

Believe me it makes them feel better. Help them to feel better. For SOME, IT ACTUALLY SATISFIES THEIR SOUL.
