Smart phones like any other technology aid to the comfort of human beings.
As the name suggests, they are ‘smart ‘ , in the sense they have their own intelligence which allow user’s wit to take  back seat in dealing with day- today chores.
Adding to the comfort, they have made things go ‘instant’ too.
This has been made possible through the development of various applications popularly known as ‘apps’.
There are multiple apps available for a specific purpose, be it messaging or a cab service. I shall not get into this because we are well aware of them.

In short, they have brought comfort on our finger tips. And not just the comfort, they have done a real work in sociery upliftment.

And this trend will go on. It is growing at a pace we are not even able to realize .But we have to pause our tech driven life game and contemplate. Have these devices occupied an irreplaceable corner of our existence or is it just enslavement? In other words, can we really not survive without them or is it just a habit or say a comfort zone we have created for ourselves?

This has nothing to do with our increased dependency on smart devices and sorts. The glitch with our tech friendly life is the changing companionship. The very nature of human beings allows them to interact with one another and derive pleasure out of each other’s presence. These devices have evolved into ‘smart’ to enhance and ease that experience.  Instead, they are being employed more as a substitute than a means.  

Today, we crave more for virtual attention than an actual human companion. We communicate but do not talk. We are connected with ones who are far away but oblivious of our own surrounding.  We have been so severely paralyzed by them that we are incapable of catering an undivided attention to our immediate environment.  From just exterminating loneliness in one’s life, smartphones are invading the personal relationship that people share with one another.  

The concern is, it is us, the master of all technologies who allows them to overpower our priorities.  No doubt, smart phones have proven to be the best assistants but should not colonize our personal space.
