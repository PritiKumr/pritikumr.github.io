## Middle class life

When I take a look at the person who thrive for success or who sees their job as a matter of survival, they are mostly from middle class background.

Most of us have faced many struggles in our life which has moulded us to be the better person as we are today.

In my story, when I was studying 9th grade. My dad faced a major business loss which in turn affected our financial status alot where my mom had to go for a job. At that time she was a BA graduate. She joined in a school as a teacher.

BA qualification is not enough to be a teacher. She had to do B.Ed. Even in that critical financial situation, she chose to study. She completed her B.Ed.

When I was doing my homeworks, my mom was doing her assignments. I don't know how many of them could do this.

She did her household work, went for job, did her assignments and also looked after us. I don't know how many of us would have their own mother as inspiration or role model. 

To set someone as an example, who is self determined, who is not afraid of the ups and downs of life, who can understand the philosophy of life and teach us the same.

I am one of the middle class people who thrive alot for success as I have seen the struggles my parents have faced. They have never let down me. Even in very bad financial situation, my school fees were paid regularly. I was never a defaulter. I went for all the school excursion. My parents made sure that I had everything.

The struggles which we face in our life are hard for that point of time. But I am sure, it is moulding us to be better version for ourselves. For example, My mom completed her MA and teaching has become her passion. If there wasn't a financial crisis, this would have never happened. 

I would consider that financial crisis as a butterfly effect. Because of which she did her higher studies and found her passion after so many years of marriage. Also she has set herself as a role model/inspiration for myself and my sister.

Now, we can face any difficult situations in our life with self esteem, determination and hope that everything is for a better tomorrow.

This is just my story. There are different middle class stories which has made their kids as the best as they are today.
