For the people who under-rate engineers for what they are.
To everyone out there who judge engineers for taking the job they are not related to!
First let me put out some of the questions to you now.

### Do you know how difficult it is to get a job after studying engineering?

Even though if you get a good job, do you know how difficult it is to sustain in that job?
Do you ever know the level of competition we face studying in mediocre college?
To get job in core is easy but to sustain there for low salary is not easy for middle class students like us. For a fresher, salary in core jobs starts from 6k. Whereas we middle class people study taking educational loans apart from that we also have got other responsibilities.

Let me put it simple here, none in this world works for self satisfaction alone. So you people are working in your related fields, would you work for 0 salary? No! Right. The bitter truth is that we all work for money. 
Why it is so bothering you us not working in our own related fields? What cheap happiness you get saying that again and again? Stop under-rating people. Let’s rewind to some time back, there are so many people I know who roamed out there in our age without any concern on family or any objective in life and now judging about us taking up jobs not related to engineering.

Let’s do some approximate calculations.
In Tamil Nadu, there are 552 engineering college. Top rated colleges would have in average of 150students for each branch. In medium rated college 90students and in low rated colleges 60 students. So for each branch in engineering average of 100 students. Total count is (552*100=55200) let’s consider major branches in engineering alone because the number is frightening already: P.

So the major branches are EEE, ECE, IT, CSE, MECH, CIVIL which implies (55200*6) 331200 (Tamil Nadu count alone) students per year. Whether they complete their course or not each one of them are in compulsion to find a job which gradually increases the level of competition.

Students who study in top rated colleges are so lucky as they at least get so much of opportunities.
And we people who study in mediocre/ low rated colleges of course gets opportunities for not so core related jobs. I personally attended a job interview where 3000ppl competed with me on the same day. I am pretty sure if you people have faced such a lot of competition you would have fed with life.

You can raise a question now. “Then why did you choose engineering?”

> We too have question for you “Why the hell didn’t you explain the scenario for us before?”

There are only two possibilities.
You have had the same knowledge we have had when we were studying 12th

(OR)

You people are so eagerly waiting to look at us fail.
Some of us here chose engineering out of interest but sadly we couldn’t take up the job we like due to family situations and lack of opportunities. 

It is actually not a problem until we love the job we do. It’s even worse when we don’t do the job we like as we are already in stress. You have no idea of the stress we face thinking of our future, money paybacks and the worry of us not able to follow the dreams we have due to family situations.

> It is really okay if you are not being supportive, at least stop being sarcastic. We are not wasted people, one day we will be more successful than you are as we realise the financial status of our family earlier than you people. Always remember we are all well determined!!
