# How to be happy

> Happiness depends on you not others.

You think others influence your happiness.
I can explain it's not true,
Our brain creates illusion.It's just we gotta break through that illusion and create illusion which favours us
Let us see.

If you think, that if someone ignores you and you feel sad.. It's only because you *think* so.
You should start thinking what you want whether you to worry or to be happy.
If you wanna happy you should apparently stop worrying.
You may ask now *but how?*

Start doing things you like. Diverting yourself.Yes you have all the energy, courage to do it.Just believe that you can do it.Stay committed to something, work hard towards it.

When your boss scolds for you not being perfect and it makes you worry?

Learn to the fullest.Neva mind what others judge about you.Because if you are not gonna believe yourself who else wouldâ€‹? Believe that you are the best thing in the world.

At the beginning, no one can be perfect.
Committing mistakes is learning

You can learn only when you make a mistake.Learning is progress,why would you be sad for moving forward?

> You lose someone

I Know it is really hard to overcome this.But we should move forward or else time wld start moving forward.You lost someone which doesn't imply you lost yourself.you should overcome it.Think everything is for good.Do things you like.Count on the people you still have and be grateful for it.

> Life doesn't turn up as you expected

You did everything you can.you did your best so it's not your mistake.We gotta just accept life as it is. Cherish every moment.Afterall life is too short.You Neva know what will happen next moment.May be one day life would turn up as you wish or you may die the next moment.Nothing is predictable.Just accept the way life is and stop regretting things.

*Don't create negative vibes which would affect the people around you too. Always remember negative vibes are contagious just like that of positive vibes.*

# Question is what you choose?
