## Universal truth is everyone makes mistake. How much ever this is true, Everyone constantly judges others.

I came up on this topic in the urge of searching self motivation.

It's inevitable that people will judge for your mistakes and we would have one kind of feel which is a mixture of self pity and another one is anger.

Self pity is the thought we have thinking whether others are right about you,. Whether you are not capable enough.

Anger is due to the things what others say. We would feel everyone are mean to us and they are judging us irrationally.

If the person feeds the self pity thought, it would inturn discourage him/her and in fact makes him believe that he is really not capable of things.

If the person feeds the anger it may end up unwanted situations inturn chaos.

* So how are we going to handle this agression inside us?

We should disgread that self pity thought, Truth is everyone would have made mistakes what matters is what we have learnt from it. Never allow anyone's opinion to discourage you. It's just their opinion. We really knew what we are capable of.

And now the agression, I won't say aggression is a bad thing. I would rather suggest we should be assertive on our behaviors and let aggression grow inside. Use the aggression to prove ourselves that we are capable of anything.

Be positive and let the aggression grow inside and think what we have learnt from our mistakes and how can we improve ourselves. Even this thought will itself distinguish you from others. It's never a sad ending until we accept that it is.
