# KEY POINTS OF A BUSINESS

Business is a word  which is used as  a fashion trend these days and even  sometimes referred with a  different name “startup”. People who have money or have a different idea start converting that idea into a product that could be sold.

But hey people, you missed a very important point there,  business is not just an idea, it’s a long term process, it’s not just a cycle of 1 or 2 years, but it’s a cycle of your whole life and it should continue even after your death.

There are some points which I am going to share today with everyone, which need to be considered before starting any business. It doesn’t matter what type of business it is, either it’s a small turnover business or a big turnover, these points are common for all type of industries.

#### Let’s see the points now :-

1. **You should have the courage to handle risks:**  Many times big opportunities will knock your door but it won’t come alone, it will come with lots of risk involved. But If you want to grow your business, you should have the courage to handle them to take those opportunities to the next level.

2. **You should be money minded:** It’s not about being cheap or greedy  but it’s about being a business person, even if your business has turnover of Rs. 1 crore you can’t afford to loose even 1 rupee. There are many businesses which has just one rupee margin over one piece of product. So imagine if you sell 1 crore such product, one day how much will you earn. So, always remember every single penny counts just as every drop matters in making an ocean.

3. **You should always be ready to learn everything:** In initial stage of your business, you might not be aware of different tasks involved or how much human labour will be needed to complete them. Everyone whoever works for you , they all are employees they won’t take your business as seriously as you do. So you have to be prepared for all ups and downs and you have to be ready to do whatever it takes to take your business forward. For example , my dad owns a business which requires many labourers to load and unload  the truck. Once one labour got sick who had to unload one truck, my dad couldn’t say to those people to go back as it would have taken more time to call other labourers and before no entry gets opened we had to release the truck. So, finally my dad himself worked as a labourer and helped other labourers in unloading the truck. So, you have to take the responsibility of everything whenever it is needed when you own a business.

4. **You have to understand it’s a 24*7 work:** Everything has definite time no doubt, but remember that there are things which can require your attention anytime and  sometimes it can be your business also. For eg if you own a datacenter and if in the midnight  one plug goes off and that powers up East Asia, then you can’t be just sleeping you have to wake up in the middle of night and fix it up. That’s how it works “ with bigger power comes bigger responsibility”

5. **Your business should never go to the revenue of zero:** Last but not the least, the most important point, once your business start making revenues, remember whatever it takes just make sure revenue should never go to zero. If it does, it means it’s a signal that market has stopped showing interest in your business, that’s the point when you need to rework on your business.

_For the closing lines I will just give one  advice, whatever you do,  it should solve problem of atleast one person . So before starting with anything always do a good market research._

Keep making money ;)
