	Where women are respected, there the gods delight; and where they are not,
	 		there all works and efforts come to naught.


After so many years of *Equality Talks*,you think women are respected? Do we actually respect women?

Ok, No pressure. Try answering me for this one. Do women really have equal rights? Haan? Now this one, do we atleast know what are some problems faced by any woman?.

At first when a girl baby is born, most Indians behave as if its a disgrace as dowry has to be given when she gets married. Dowry makes the difference. A man sells himself for the dowry and also takes away the girl and her dreams with him.

Atleat before marriage, was she actually allowed to follow her dreams?

No! Not in most cases.

Ironically, the first one to suppress a women is another women. When she wants to explore things,they are restricted saying that it is not meant for girls and when she fights her way out of it follows the bigger miseries. The problem starts with stalkers. Every month,there is atleast one news that somewhere a tech girl has been raped or murdered or both. The aftereffect of this, some parents who left their daughter to follow their dreams also start to restrict them. Why? Just why? You don't know how much we fought for a chance to pursue our dreams.

Now comes the buzz word *marriage*. Most women choose to stay with their husband despite the assaults they go through. Now why is that? Only because they are afraid of the society and feel this is what was meant for them and is something that cannot be changed. Since her childhood the restrictions and "behave-like-a-girl" has been following her. Parents restricted her from following her dreams, she now has no idea of how to be independent and when she thinks of going back to her parents place also she would be treated as its a big disgrace for their family. So forgetting about her dreams and adjusting to the brutalities ,she starts to live for her husband. Atleast by then is she happy? Naah! There are so many unsaid murders because of dowries, impotence. Since she is not well educated,the cycle repeats.She would now restrict her daughter from following her dreams and the cycle repeats.

Fundamentally, Education and Awareness plays the major role.

**If you educate a woman, you educate a family, if you educate a girl, you educate the future.** - Queen Rania of Jordan.

I don't blame on the whole society. There are people who support a woman's growth but still the cruelities continues to happen. We have identified the problem and also the solution.The problem is inequality and the solution is education. Implementation is in our hands,the future generation!!
