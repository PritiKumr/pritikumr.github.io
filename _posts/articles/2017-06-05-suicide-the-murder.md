## Yes I say, suicide is the new murder by two possibilities. 

We all have friends. We all have fun with them, laugh with them every day. But do we know them actually?

Do we know what they are going through personally?

You may ask me, why we should interfere in other’s life..

Not everyone can handle stress as some of us can do. As I said in my earlier article “Everybody deserves a listener”

We have a large group of people as friends. I don’t blame anyone in particular, but we’re living in a wrong way. We judge/criticise others with the things we know. We never know the actual story.

I remember a story that I read in a book, where there will be a woman working in highest position in an organisation who will keep a big flower in her hair every day.

Every person in her office judges the way she dresses and laughs at her as all we would have done.

One day, one of her office mate found her crying. When she was questioned why, she said that it’s her mother’s death anniversary and her mother will always keep a flower in her hair.

In her remembrance, she has decorated her hair everyday with flower.

Instead of speaking behind her or judging her, they could have asked her directly why she dresses like that.

People bottle up feelings in the fear of whether the counterpart will listen to them empathetically or would just judge them. In short, they don’t have trust on us to share their feelings.

Bottling up feelings leads to stress and you know where stress leads to..

Yes! Suicide is murder, we all kill that person. We could have helped him/her, but we failed.

And that person who has committed suicide kills us everyday little by little by making us think of the possibilities how we could have saved him/her.

It’s absolutely fine, if you’re not supportive but at least try not to judge people and gossip with what we know, it is fun but it can take away people’s life.
