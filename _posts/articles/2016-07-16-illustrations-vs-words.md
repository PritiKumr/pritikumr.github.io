*4.5 Billion years ago*, our beautiful Earth, round and blue came into the picture of solar system bundled with uniqueness talking for itself. A little later life found it's way a few billion years later. Evolution took us for a ride bringing us to this point in time. Looking back to the early stages of human, there was some thing that was missing.

###### What was it? Not Sure?

*Communication*, without which life would be really boring. Now, we communicate using words but what about some million years ago?

No alphabets. No words. Yet our ancestors managed to survive without words for communication. Isn't that something amazing to even think about. :D

But how did they communicate? How? 

###### Umm, Illustrations. 

Our ancestors communicated with their neighbours using illustrations. What is Illustration? Now stop thinking technically. :P

Its nothing but the action or means of illustrating something. Doesn't stop with just that. Hmm, It also mean as expressing by as Drawings or Designs. Cool. Ain't it?

Old sculptures, statues, art works always stand an epitome for how cool communication was earlier. The beautiful and intricate Illustrations in it shows us Illustration was the main key for communication those days. It made people understand things easily and it also helped the differently abled(deaf and dumb) to not really think themselves any lesser people. But, as days and years passed with technological advancements people started to forget the beauty in communication using Illustrations. I see people using more of words to communicate and not the illustrations. 

I feel so bad to see the world putting an end to a beautiful art of communication. If Illustration was the key for communication in 2016 and not words , there is absolutely no need for any languages or translators to communicate. It would have made world more united and simple to survive. 

Words are just too complicated. Are they not? By the way, too ambuiguous.

In my case, Ha ha ! I use more of words but I always wanted illustrations to be my primary source of communication. It gives me more knowledge and deepens my ability to understand things with ease. 

Do you think the same way? Let me know. :D
