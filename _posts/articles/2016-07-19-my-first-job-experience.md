*Just another regular 2016 passout with much hopes in life, I found a new side of myself in this journey of 2 months.*

As a fresher,I joined an IT company as a software trainee.Since I am from EEE department,I was little nervous thinking whether I could survive in the company.Unlike other IT companies,Here for few weeks they thought us how to analyse a problem.After we came to an understanding of how to analyse a problem,the next phase of training started.

## FIRST PHASE

A project requirement was kept in front of us.It was to create a web application for recruiting process.It consisted of  four modules such as generic module,HR module,Jobseeker module and Employee module.It was then split among 10 of us and we started to work on it.
At first I didn't feel any difficulty as the first step was to analyse the requirement,prepare BRD,FSD,wireframes and get approval from the client.

## SECOND PHASE

The second phase was UI design training.The trainer taught us in such a way that the training was so interesting and it kept us committed.HTML and CSS was new to me.I started to learn every day and started to try it practically.I was keep on experimenting unti I came to an understanding.By then ,we 10 of us were clear about basics of HTML and CSS.We started to design our pages as per our wireframes using bootstrap.First we were trained with plain html and then we were taught about bootstrap such that we felt easy and was very clear  about the basics.

## THIRD PHASE

The third phase was validation before the datas hit the database.They taught us javascript and Jquery.I found it  very interesting because with Jquery we can do wonders without making the page reload.Ajax concept was so cool such that we can call upon a function using url without reloading
the page.Jquery effects,traversing functions and much more functions.It was very interesting such that we tried making tabs,accordion on our own.Untill then everything went cool and I enjoyed learning these and also felt easy implementing it.

## FOURTH PHASE

After we completing validations.We were into the php training.Our pages were put into mvc architecture(Model View Controller).We created tables in mysql as defined in FSD and then started work on functionalities.The trainer taught us how to make a login page,some of the php functions,session and cookies.We had test on every Monday for four weeks.First three weeks it was theoritical and it consisted of logical questions.Some how we cleared our tests.I learnt how to use html inside php code and vice versa.PHP is like an ocean when we start exploring it,we start to realise how interesting the langauge is.All we have to do is get involved with it,start exploring it.When I first joined this company,I didn't even know to define a class,method and declare a variable also.Now i have confidence,that i can create a web application on my own.Debugging an error in php is also an interesting factor.We learnt to use firebug,check page source and rectify the errors.Now the fourth phase has also been completed successfully and the journey with the company continues.

I'm gonna be sharing more of my posts until the world knows me. Stay connected. Cheers! :D
